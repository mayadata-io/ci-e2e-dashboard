      application and OpenEBS pods (controllers & replicas)</p>
    <h3 class="my-2">Running chaos tests on live deployments:</h3>
    <p class="py-3" style="color:#54576b">End users can run ready chaos tests against the live deployment by choosing the test on the portal itself. When
      the test is run, they can see the status of Kubernetes resources changing accordingly in the real time and how
      OpenEBS continues to provide data availability to the stateful application.</p>
